# Welcome; whether you came here by accident or on purpose! 👋
I'm your tourguide, Henry and I've recently gained 15 lbs in exchange for completing a rigourous bootcamp known as App Academy where I immersed myself into the world of coding.

Chemistry teacher turned software engineer. Not the most obvious transition but surprisingly shares similarities. Chemistry; form hypothesis for experiments -> test experiment 🧪 -> note results for future use/avoid/improve upon. Sounds like coding logic where you have to figure out how to go about a problem, then testing it; if it doesn't work; back to the drawing board or if it works; see how it can be improved upon time/space-wise.

What drew me to pursue becoming a SWE was the fact that I liked solving problems and the fact that software engineering was constantly changing was basically an endless source of problems for free~

📚 currently learning python 🐍

However; it's easy to get burnt out so what kept me going are my hobbies listed below:

Hobbies 
Interested in most sports but primarily tennis 🎾, pickleball as of late, and bouldering after being introduced to it recently 🧗‍♀️ 
- I enjoy playing board games / solving riddles/problems (I despise crosswords though)
- My cats 🐈 
- walks
- going to zoos/aquariums/museuems (preferably larger ones so I can get myself lost in them)

🏡 I currently reside in NYC and occasionally string tennis rackets as well. If you ever want to reach me for anything (tennis/boardgames/hang out/cat pics included) I can be reached at 4henrylin17@gmail.com. Cheers!
