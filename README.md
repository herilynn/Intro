# Welcome; whether you came here by accident or on purpose! 👋
I'm your tourguide, Henry and I've recently gained 15 lbs in exchange for completing a rigourous bootcamp known as App Academy where I immersed myself into the world of coding.

📚 currently learning python 🐍 

Interests ⚡ 
Interested in most sports but primarily tennis 🎾, pickleball as of late, and bouldering after being introduced to it recently 🧗‍♀️ 
I enjoy playingh board games / solving riddles/problems (I despise crosswords though)
My cats 🐈 

🏡 I currently reside in NYC and occasionally string tennis rackets as well. If you ever want to reach me for anything (tennis/boardgames/hang out/cat pics included) I can be reached at 4henrylin17@gmail.com. Cheers!
